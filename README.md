From this project, I learned Django's MVT concepts, basic CRUD operations, concepts of Django REST API, Django forms, pagination, how to work with JSON, and many more.
The challenge for me was to adapt to a new framework in a short period of time, and in this project, it seemed difficult for me to encounter the JSON file and save it to the database.
This is the first project that I deployed on a server. Considering this site, I learned how to deploy a Django project on PythonAnywhere.

This project has the functionality of:
i.Create operation
ii.Read operation
iii.Update operation
iv.Delete operation
v.Uploading JSON files and saving them to the database
vi.Create, Read, Update, Delete using API
It would have been interesting if I had added authentication and an admin panel to this project.
